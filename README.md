# Tic Tac Toe with mTouch
Sample source code for DIY PR28. Project description : This PIC microcontroller based project is designed to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game using mTouch. mTouch, also known as capacitive touch sensor, can replace mechanical buttons with capacitive alternative. In addition, it helps in cost reduction. mTouch has become more prevalent and in demand for commercial applications such as mobile devices and mp3 players. Thus, this project will show users how to work with mTouch. For information, PR28 uses internal oscillator to run the program.
